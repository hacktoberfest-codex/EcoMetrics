                We propose the development of EcoMetrics, an integrated
                environmental monitoring platform that provides real-time
                air and water quality data. This web-based solution
                empowers individuals, communities, and policymakers with
                information to foster environmental awareness,
                engagement, and advocacy. EcoMetrics combines data
                collection, integration, analysis, and user engagement to
                create a comprehensive environmental monitoring
                ecosystem. Our goal is to serve as a one-stop solution for
                environmental monitoring, education, and advocacy, building
                a community of environmentally-conscious individuals and
                driving positive change in environmental policies and
                practices.
